Software engineer focused on AI agents, LLM tooling, and applied machine learning.

## What I'm Building

**AI Agents & Tooling**
- [40k-mcp-server](https://github.com/Emeier2/40k-mcp-server) — MCP server that gives LLMs access to Warhammer 40k rules data for gameplay analysis and army list building. Python, vector search, Monte Carlo simulation.
- [job-search-mcp](https://github.com/Emeier2/job-search-mcp) — MCP server that bulk-polls job boards (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby), scores jobs against preferences, and surfaces matches. Python, SQLite, background polling.

**Applications**
- [quiltify](https://github.com/Emeier2/quiltify) — AI-powered Elizabeth Hartman-style quilt pattern generator. Text or photo to buildable cutting guides with yardage calculations and SVG/PDF export. Python/FastAPI, React, FLUX.1-dev, Ollama.

**Foundations**
- [ML](https://github.com/Emeier2/ML) — Machine learning library built from scratch in Python.
