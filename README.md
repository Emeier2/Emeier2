# Ethan Meier

Software engineer focused on AI agents, LLM tooling, and applied machine learning.

## What I'm Building

**AI Agents & Tooling**
- [job-search-mcp](https://github.com/Emeier2/job-search-mcp) — MCP server that bulk-polls Greenhouse, Lever, and Ashby job boards, scores jobs against your preferences using local keyword matching, and surfaces matches with minimal LLM credit usage. TypeScript, SQLite, Zod.
- [40k-mcp-server](https://github.com/Emeier2/40k-mcp-server) — MCP server that gives LLMs access to Warhammer 40k rules data for gameplay analysis and army list building. Python, vector search, Monte Carlo simulation.
- **manseai** — AI-powered voice agent backend for real estate lead qualification. FastAPI service behind ElevenLabs Conversational AI with compliance gating, lead scoring, and appointment booking.
- **Slacker** — Natural-language Slack search agent built on the Anthropic API.

**Applications**
- **Realify** — Full-stack real estate platform. Python/FastAPI backend, React frontend, AWS infrastructure (DynamoDB, S3, Terraform).
- **Eldritch Wrangler** — iOS horror creature-capture game. Swift, SwiftUI, SpriteKit, and Metal. MVVM architecture.

**Foundations**
- [ML](https://github.com/Emeier2/ML) — Machine learning library built from scratch in Python.
